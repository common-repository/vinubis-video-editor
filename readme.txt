== Description ==
**Make your videos look professional! Use pre-built video styles / video themes to get ready in minutes. Even get your custom template if you like. Examples at [wordpress.tv](http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017).**

VINUBIS Video Editor for Wordpress (WP VIDEO EDITOR) is a service which provides you with an online file library (in order to use any videos or files in a video project, you have to upload them) and an online video editor. It's necessary to sign up to our service (the registration process can be done in the plugin itself), because we create individual accounts for each user in order to be able to assign each created video project to the right user. All the videos and files you upload in our plugin are uploaded onto our servers (which are located in Germany). We will never share these files with a third party (to read more about data privacy protection, please read our terms of service).

During the registration process, we'll ask for your eMail address (don't worry we won't spam you), name, surname and you have to set a password. With these credentials you can then login to the video editor plugin.

Our Wordpress Plugin enables you to transform your own videos recorded with smartphone, webcam, digicam or even professional equipment with only a few clicks into ready made, edited, branded as well as optimized video clips. Feel free to use the final videos on your blog, website, Youtube, Twitter, Facebook or any other source of your choice. Like in Wordpress you can easily choose your preferred and modified layout for your videos.
